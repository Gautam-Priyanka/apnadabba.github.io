								<h4>Section 6: Cancellation</h4>
						<h5> o 6.1. </h5>
						<p>You must notify the participating kitchen
                        immediately if you decide to cancel your order,
                        preferably by phone, and quote your order number.
                        If the kitchen accepts your cancellation, no
                        cancellation fee applies. If the kitchen refuses
                        cancellation, e.g. because preparation of Food
                        Delivery has been completed and/or delivery
                        personnel has already been dispatched, it may not
                        be cancelled. We will not be able to refund any
                        order, which has been already dispatched.</p>

                    <h5> o 6.2.</h5>
						<p>We may cancel a contract if the product is
                        not available for any reason. We will notify you if this
                        is the case and return any payment that you have
                        made;</p>
                    <h5> o 6.3. </h5>
					<p>If the cancellation was made in time and
                        once the kitchen has accepted your cancellation, we
                        will refund or re-credit your debit or credit card with
                        the full amount within 14 days, which includes the
                        initial delivery charge (where applicable) which you
                        paid for the delivery of the Goods or the Services,
                        as applicable.

					<p>In the unlikely event that the Participating
                        Kitchen delivers a wrong item, you have the right to
                        reject the delivery of the wrong item and you shall
                        be fully refunded for the missing item. If the
                        Participating Kitchen can only do a partial delivery
                        (a few items might be not available), we will inform
                        you or propose a replacement for missing items.
                        You have the right to refuse a partial order before
                        delivery and get a refund.
